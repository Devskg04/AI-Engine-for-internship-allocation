# ML-Enhanced Internship Allocation System

## üöÄ Overview

The internship allocation system has been significantly enhanced with **Machine Learning capabilities** to move beyond fixed scoring rules and create intelligent, adaptive student-internship matching.

## üîÑ What Was Changed

### 1. **Added MLAllocationEngine Class**
- **Purpose**: Core ML engine for intelligent allocation decisions
- **Model**: Uses `GradientBoostingRegressor` for advanced compatibility prediction
- **Features**: 16 sophisticated features including skills matching, CGPA analysis, location preferences, and diversity factors

### 2. **Enhanced Allocation Logic**
**Before (Fixed Rules):**
```python
def calculate_match_score(self, candidate, internship):
    # Fixed weights: Field(30) + CGPA(25) + Location(20) + Experience(15) + Skills(10)
    score = field_score + cgpa_score + location_score + experience_score + skill_score
    return score
```

**After (ML-Enhanced):**
```python
def calculate_match_score(self, candidate, internship):
    # Try ML prediction first
    ml_score = self.ml_allocation_engine.predict_compatibility(candidate, internship)
    if ml_score is not None:
        return ml_score
    # Fallback to traditional scoring
    return self._calculate_traditional_score(candidate, internship)
```

### 3. **Smart Training System**
- **Data Sources**: 
  - Historical allocation outcomes
  - Student feedback and satisfaction ratings
  - Synthetic data generation for initial training
  - Resume parsing results
- **Auto-Training**: System automatically trains when sufficient data available
- **Continuous Learning**: Model improves with each allocation and feedback

### 4. **Advanced Feature Engineering**
The ML model uses 16 sophisticated features:
- **Academic**: CGPA, education level, CGPA vs requirements
- **Skills**: Jaccard similarity, overlap ratio, skill group matching
- **Experience**: Months of experience, field relevance
- **Preferences**: Location matching, preferred sectors
- **Diversity**: District type, social category, gender, past participation
- **Internship**: Stipend, duration, skill requirements

## üß† Machine Learning Approach

### Model Architecture
```
Input Features (16) ‚Üí Feature Scaling ‚Üí GradientBoosting ‚Üí Compatibility Score (0-100)
```

### Training Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical allocations and outcomes
2. **Synthetic Data**: Generate realistic training samples when data is limited
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert candidate/internship pairs to numerical features
4. **Model Training**: Train GradientBoostingRegressor with cross-validation
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Track training and validation accuracy
